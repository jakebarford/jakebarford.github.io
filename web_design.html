							<h3>The Basics</h3>
							<p>A website is more than just having an online presence. It reflects who and what you are as a buisness, and what you want to come across as to the mass audience of the internet - the idea being that people can visit you site, and easily and succinctly understand your product/service, whilst gaining a sense of both professionalism and integrity as a company.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>In order to create a site that you love, and get the most out of it. I need to chat with you directly. This can be done over the phone, in a meeting or even online. The medium in which we have it matters very little, what does matter - is that I can get a feel of what kind of style you are aiming for, and what you actually want the site to achieve/convey. After that we can really get along with the whole design process, and I can start showing you previews and aspects of the final design. Once you are completely satified with the site, we progress to testing and releasing your new site to the world. If you have any questions regarding my processes, or simply would like some more information, please click the 'Contact Me' page.</p>
